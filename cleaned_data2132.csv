"the design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all.",0,73
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.,1,56
i advise everyone do not be fooled,0,34
so far so good.,1,15

this case seems well made.,1,26
disappointed with battery.,0,26
not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.,0,51

best i've found so far .... i've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality  as well as ease of using.,1,118
i'm very disappointed with my decision.,0,39
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone.,1,51

it's really easy.,1,17
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.,1,69
fantastic earphones.,1,20
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car.,1,55
low quality.,0,12
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.,1,53
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before.,1,76
warning - stay away.,0,20
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money.,0,53
awsome device works great.,1,26
i used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.,0,94
"if you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.i would not recommend this to anyone.",0,113
very displeased.,0,16
"i might have gotten a defect, but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.",0,102
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install.,0,63
restored my phone to like new performance.,1,42
"i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q, go figure.",1,103
"i searched the internet, and found this one to be the best value.",1,65
does not fit.,0,13
very happy with this product.,1,29
"the screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.",1,104
there's really nothing bad i can say about this headset.,0,56
"i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.",1,82
portable and it works.,1,22
"my colleague & i now get great reception.a little expensive, but performance is great.",1,86
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20  left in the morning.,0,134
i've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again.,0,110
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.,0,42
timely shipment and quality product.,1,36
nice solid keyboard.,1,20
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly.,1,50
horrible phone.,0,15
bt50 battery junk.,0,18
we would recommend these to others.,1,35
cant get the software to work with my computer.,0,47
disappointed.,0,13
poor voice clarity.,0,19
the battery works great,1,23
no buyers remorse on this one.,0,30
very disappointed in accessoryone.,0,34
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.,0,99
"looks great and is strong.""",1,27
"i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and i am pretty happy with it.",1,79
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.,0,49
disappointment.. i hate anything that goes in my ear.,0,53
great software for motorolas.,1,29
the delivery was on time.,1,25
very easy to use.,1,17
"uncomfortable in the ear, don't use with lg vx9900 .",0,52
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.,0,68
"it holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.",1,130
i'd like to return it.,0,22
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i don't expect any problems.,1,97
"verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.",0,97
"after charging overnight, these batteries work great.",1,53
you won't regret it,1,19
i love this phone.,1,18
a disappointment.,0,17
its not user friendly.,0,22
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.,0,140
"then i exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.",0,68
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.,0,67
this pda rocks.,1,15
"it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.",1,101
"i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price",1,110
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.,1,57
pretty piece of junk.,0,21
plug was the wrong size.,0,24
works as described.,1,19
save your money.... i've had this item for 11 months now.,0,57
bad purchase.,0,13
well im satisfied.,1,18
"the bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a nyc commuter.",1,81
this battery is an excellent bargain,1,36
defective crap.,0,15
i would have given no star if i was able.,0,41
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them.,1,42
"the sound quality for the device is unacceptable.unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.",0,112
i would not recommend this item to anyone.,0,42
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.,0,59
great...no problems at all.,1,27
"as an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.",0,69
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.,1,56
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.,0,106
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.,1,80
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.,1,116
"very good product, well made.",1,29
mobile phone tools are a must have.,1,35
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.,1,83
"i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, i am very excited to have this source.",1,145
the phone is sturdy and waterproof.,1,35
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.,0,75
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5,0,87
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price,1,68
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.,1,70
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great.,1,75
works great.,1,12
really ugly.,0,12
"horrible, had to switch 3 times.",0,32
the noise shield is incrediable.,1,32
no real improvement.,0,20
razr battery - good buy.,1,24
keep up the good work amazon,1,28
they refuse to refund or replace.,0,33
unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.,0,149
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,0,57
great case and price,1,20
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.i am not impressed and i am not laughing.,0,131
"bluetooth range is good - a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.",1,128
"small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.",1,78
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.,1,103
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,0,53
i am glad i purchased it.,1,25
i've missed numerous calls because of this reason.,0,50
"perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when i use this.",0,73
don't buy this product.,0,23
"sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.",0,54
"no shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid.",1,122
worst software ever used.... if i could give this zero stars i would.,0,69
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,0,61
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.,0,85
"i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.",1,111
"i love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.",1,51
thank you for such great service.,1,33
its a total package.,1,20
"the seller is very understanding and patient, i would definitely buy from them again.",1,85
i give wirefly 1 star.i will contact cingular/at&t; and inform them of this practice.,0,85
it's aggravating,0,16
great product for the price.,1,28
"i have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use",1,95
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone,1,57
"none of it works, just don't buy it.",0,36
"muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.",0,102
please dont waste your money.,0,29
"all in all, i'm quite satisfied with this purchase.",1,51
"if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking, this isn't it.",0,83
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.,0,65
disapointing results.,0,21
cumbersome design.,0,18
"great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then i expected",1,95
great product.,1,14
it's a piece of crap,0,20
"my experience was terrible..... this was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra (which i hated",0,142
this fixes all the problems.,1,28
worst ever.,0,11
i am very happy,1,15
"i've had no trouble accessing the internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.",1,101
"i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?""",0,61
the battery life is highly unacceptable.,0,40
that company is a joke.,0,23
it does everything the description said it would.,1,49
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset.,0,76
"it works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.",1,98
"verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.",0,144
"voice quality, signal strength, dropped calls.",0,46
"it plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.",1,137
better than expected.,1,21
"it feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.",0,132
battery is holding up well.,1,27
also difficult to put on.i'd recommend avoiding this product.,0,61
"i only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.",0,64
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...i went to plug it in and it started smoking.,0,117
sprint - terrible customer service.,0,35
linked to my phone without effort.,1,34
they are so cool,1,16
easy to use.,1,12
better than new.,1,16
"what possesed me to get this junk, i have no idea...",0,52
piece of trash.,0,15
a pretty good product.,1,22
this is a great phone.,1,22
"for the price on amazon, it is an excellent product, which i would highly recommend.",1,84
their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing.,1,75
"the real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.",0,57
those phones are working just fine now.,1,39
i am more than happy with this product.,1,39
poor construction.,0,18
this is infuriating.,0,20
"overall, i would recommend this phone over the new walkman.",1,59
sprint charges for this service.,0,32
"it is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.",0,48
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on.,1,42
it doesn't work in europe or asia.,0,34
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.,1,87
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.,1,134
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.,1,113
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy samsung e715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.,0,99
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.,0,82
poor product.,0,13
however i needed some better instructions.,0,42
you need two hands to operate the screen.this software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,0,124
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc .,1,74
"steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.",0,103
do not buy do not buyit sucks,0,29
this is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers.,1,59
"plus, i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.",0,67
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.,1,116
very dissapointing performance.,0,31
don't make the same mistake that i did and please don't buy this phone.,0,71
this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand.,0,62
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,0,104
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.,1,85
don't bother - go to the store.,0,31
"i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the fire red and it's a great color",1,109
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.,1,77
you get what you pay for i guess.,0,33
"not only did the software do a great job of this, i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection.",1,137
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.,1,86
these are fabulous,1,18
"however, bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.",0,126
i used bitpim to transfer data to the phone.the price of the cable was excellent.,1,81
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.,0,49
"performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.",0,104
very wind-resistant.,1,20
"obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.",0,77
"they do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.easy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried.",1,135
"i contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if i couldn't produce my receipt i was out of luck.",0,142
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something,0,83
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.,1,44
great phone.,1,12
"when i placed my treo into the case, not only was it not snug, but there was a lot of extra room on the sides.",0,110
i'm pleased.,1,12
battery is terrible.,0,20
i found the product to be easy to set up and use.,1,49
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.,0,80
utter crap.. sound quality is terrible.,0,39
"the charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.",0,71
"no ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.",1,53
"finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor.",0,112
"the handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the treo reboots.overall, i still rate this device high.",1,144
talk about useless customer service.,0,36
"it felt too light and ""tinny."".",0,31
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in.,0,89
i'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.,1,58
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones.,1,47
its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.,1,66
does everything it should and more.,1,35
i could not recommend these more.,0,33
nice sound.,1,11
"looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment",0,66
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with.,1,58
setup went very smoothly.,1,25
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,0,60
"a must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design.",0,76
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.,0,60
"it is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.",1,80
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.,0,78
can't upload ringtones from a third party.,0,42
"bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.",0,126
truly awful.,0,12
"it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.",1,91
the volume for the ringer is real good .,1,40
and none of the tones is acceptable.,0,36
camera color balance is awful.,0,30
"this product is clearly not ready for prime time, i don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.",0,135
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat,1,47
chinese forgeries abound.,0,25
easy to pair with my samsung cell.,1,34
the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,0,69
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.,0,67
too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service,0,57
works well.,1,11
the nokia ca-42 usb cable did not work with my phone.,0,53
clear crisp sound.,1,18
"i have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.",1,75
"the biggest complaint i have is, the battery drains superfast.",0,62
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear.,0,85
do not buy if you want to use the holster.,0,42
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.,1,60
it doesn't make you look cool.,0,30
"because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.",1,69
"comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.",1,115
"also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s, preferably ripped by windows media player.",0,107
you can't beat the price on these.,1,34
"* comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash sos signals (seriously",1,113
lightweight and works well.,1,27
so just beware.,0,15
i love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-usb device to my pc.,1,73
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,0,55
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.,1,96
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since.,0,80
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i.,1,87
can't store anything but phone numbers to sim.,0,46
"it lasts less than 3o minutes, if i actually try to use the phone.my wife has the same phone with the same problem.",0,115
poor quality.,0,13
"jabra ear gels ""r"" the best.",1,28
not worth it.,0,13
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced.,0,63
"it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months, so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned.",1,136
"unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources .",0,100
it was a great phone.,1,21
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.,0,99
"good value, works fine - power via usb, car, or wall outlet.",1,60
my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.,1,101
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality,1,59
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me,0,82
"in the span of an hour, i had two people exclaim ""whoa - is that the new phone on tv??",1,86
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.,1,85
"this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100 functional.",1,94
"other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.",1,111
it has everything i need and i couldn't ask for more.,1,53
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.,0,63
this product is great... it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.,1,114
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.,0,73
t-mobile has the best customer service anywhere.,1,48
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.,1,63
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. pros,0,65
"provides good protection and looks classy, too.",1,47
krussel always good.,1,20
"the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.",1,71
the design is very good.4.,1,26
i great reception all the time.,1,31
i would highly recommend this product.,1,38
"couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in texas",0,56
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320.,0,52
"bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.",0,65
"if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you",0,89
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is,1,62
"stay away from this store, be careful.",0,38
this blueant supertooth hands-free phone speaker is awesome.,1,60
does not fit.,0,13
.... item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung sch-r450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs.,1,126
"it is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.",1,115
disappointing.,0,14
blue ant is easy to use.,1,24
cheap but hey it works.. was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.,1,81
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... i'd rather be using a disposable then this.,0,108
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.,0,77
it's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.,1,93
the nano stated it.my son was dissapointed.,0,43
the sound quality is excellent as well.,1,39
its the best headset i have used.,1,33
would not reccommend.,0,21
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that i have found to date.,1,121
just what i wanted.,1,19
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone.,0,67
wont work right or atleast for me.,0,34
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.,0,82
"but now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.bottom line... put your money somewhere else... cingular will not support it.",0,141
"i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.the good",0,99
great product.,1,14
crisp and clear.,1,16
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.,0,56
"very cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.",0,52
"i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones i have not had this problem.",0,105
the reception has been generally good.,1,38
"excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot.",1,56
great bluetooth.,1,16
i highly recommend this case.,1,29
worthwhile.,1,11
this is a great deal.,1,21
"after my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.",0,98
i am sorry i made this purchase.,0,32
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,0,111
treo and t-mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,0,118
it was horrible.,0,16
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,0,56
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,0,89
they work about 2 weeks then break.,0,35
it is simple to use and i like it.,1,34
"it's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.oh, be sure to use activesync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results",1,146
i can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.,0,54
not what i wanted.,0,18
i own 2 of these cases and would order another.,1,47
great phone.,1,12
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and i'm very happy with my purchase.,1,84
"the internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.",0,66
perfect for the ps3.,1,20
"five star plus, plus.",1,21
a good quality bargain.. i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.,1,141
$50 down the drain.,0,19
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great.,0,102
"good , works fine.",1,18
for the price this was a great deal.,1,36
"great price, too",1,16
"if there is a wind, it is completely useless.",0,45
yes it's shiny on front side - and i love it,1,44
does not work.,0,14
"at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until i plugged it into my phone .",0,89
the reception through this headset is excellent.,1,48
2 thumbs up to this seller,1,26
"i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.",1,115
improper description.... i had to return it.,0,44
#1 it works - #2 it is comfortable.,1,35
battery charge-life is quite long.,1,34
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well.,1,40
battery has no life.,0,20
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.,0,82

i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,0,75
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon.,0,95
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone,0,63
terrible.. my car will not accept this cassette.,0,48
"product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with.",0,124

"terrible product, and waste of money",0,36
last time buying from you.,0,26
it was a waste of my money.,0,27
so far it has worked like a charm.,1,34
"i have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.",1,56
"but, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.",1,145
would recommend this item.,1,26
it's been my choice headset for years.great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.,1,88

works fine.,1,11
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it.,1,57
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip.,1,101
my sister has one also and she loves it.,1,40
good quality.,1,13
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon.,0,54
excellent dual-purpose headset.,1,31
excellent.,1,10

it was that loud.glad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.,1,134
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.,0,75
"fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.",1,55
excellent product for the price.,1,32
bad reception.,0,14
this product is very high quality chinese crap,0,46
it was quite comfortable in the ear.,1,36
great phone.,1,12
don't buy this product - it fails.,0,34
everything about this product is wrong.first,0,44
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature.,1,136
"this was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.",0,103
terrible phone holder.,0,22
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.,1,45
i love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.,1,68
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.,0,73
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look.,0,63
"but despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product.",1,135
how stupid is that?,0,19
"i can hear while i'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.",1,103
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.,1,61
"good show, samsung.",1,19
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.,1,54
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.,0,76
couldn't figure it out,0,22
"my phone sounded ok , but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.",0,125
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.,0,91
"while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.",0,123
leopard print is wonderfully wild.,1,34
works for me.,1,13

much better than the hard plastic cases.,1,40
it also had a new problem.,0,26
happy so far.,1,13
cool phone.,1,11
works good.,1,11
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.,1,68
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.,0,87
"but it is great, i would really recommend it",1,44
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it.,0,69
as i said above....pretty useless,0,33
never got it,0,12
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had sound-wise.,0,69
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap,0,43
does not charge the cingular  8525 phone.,0,41

"however, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls.",0,148
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.,0,91

nice leather.,1,13
i had to purchase a different case.,0,35
it is a joy to use.,1,19
very much disappointed with this company.,0,41
very satisifed with that.,1,25
it didn't charge for me.,0,24
this is the phone to get for 2005.... i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow,1,85
buttons are too small.,0,22
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow.,1,50
love it.. great armband.,1,24
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.,1,102
"however, the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons.",0,75
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and i'm pretty happy with that decision.,1,84
i was very impressed with the price of the cases.,1,49

beautiful styling though.,1,25
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.,0,78

i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.,0,57
excellent product.,1,18
earbud piece breaks easily.,0,27
lousy product.,0,14
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.,0,89
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet.,1,53
sweetest phone,1,14
":-)oh, the charger seems to work fine.",1,38
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.,1,124
not enough volume.,0,18
echo problem....very unsatisfactory,0,35
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.,0,69
don't waste your money.,0,23
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.,0,69
adapter does not provide enough charging current.,0,49
"there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best, my mistake.",0,82
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.,0,79
phone falls out easily.,0,23
"it didn't work, people can not hear me when i talk.",0,51
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use.,0,51
i'm really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesn't work.,0,70
painful on the ear.,0,19
lasted one day and then blew up.,0,32
disappointed.,0,13
kind of flops around.,0,21
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.,0,72
what a piece of junk.. i lose more calls on this phone.,0,55
item does not match picture.,0,28
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port .,0,57
"you can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once",0,57
"a very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.",0,85
"not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.",0,97
"attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.",0,186
very little music or anything to speak of.,0,42
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.,1,106
"the rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... if it's about emptiness, it works i guess because it's empty.",0,112
wasted two hours.,0,17
"saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.",1,77
a bit predictable.,0,18
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher.,1,57
and those baby owls were adorable.,1,34
"the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.",1,76
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious.,1,58
it was so cool.,1,15
"this is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.",1,88
"it had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.",0,96
"this review is long overdue, since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.",1,109
"i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.",1,159
"it's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.",1,92
"the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  	1
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
in other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
it's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1
yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1
this short film certainly pulls no punches.  	0
graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
this is the number one best th game in the series.  	1
it deserves strong love.  	1
it is an insane game.  	1
there are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
waste your money on this game.  	1
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	1
actually, the graphics were good at the time.  	1
today the graphics are crap.  	0
as they say in canada, this is the fun game, aye.  	1
this game rocks.  	1
buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	1
it's pure brilliance.  	1
this was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
the very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre pg-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a pg-rated family movie.  	0
i wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
but it's just not funny.  	0
but even the talented carrell can't save this.  	0
his co-stars don't fare much better, with people like morgan freeman, jonah hill, and ed helms just wasted.  	0
the story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work i've ever seen.  	0
but whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0
the film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	1
it's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
on the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0
long, whiny and pointless.  	0
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	0
excellent cast, story line, performances.  	1
totally believable.  	1
anne heche was utterly convincing.  	1
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering.  	1
i sat riveted to the tv screen.  	1
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
i do think tom hanks is a good actor.  	1
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1
i was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
there is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
this movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
and, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0
often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
it crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0
there are some generally great things in it.  	1
i wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	0
the suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from g to pg.  	1
i especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, i could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
alexander nevsky is a great film.  	1
he is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	1
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots... it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business"" of québec.",0,4775
this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years.,1,52

"overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.",1,55
"plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.",1,65
give this one a look.,1,21
i gave it a 10,1,14
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted.,1,57
it is a true classic.,1,21
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b-list horror/suspense films go.,1,85
definitely worth checking out.,1,30
the problem was the script.,0,27
it was horrendous.,0,18
there was nothing believable about it at all.,0,45
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.,0,88
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.,1,97
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.,1,117
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.,1,63
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.,1,123
"if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music, and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.",1,115
i don't think you will be disappointed.,1,39

"the acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.",0,69
"it was too predictable, even for a chick flick.",0,47
too politically correct.,0,24
very disappointing.,0,19
"the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.",1,92
"i love lane, but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy.",0,59
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back.,0,45
but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.,1,53
"the acting helps the writing along very well , and it is a real joy to watch.",1,77
the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.,0,58
"the movie was so boring, that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a columbo movie before",0,150
"), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away.",0,64
the directing seems too pretentious.,0,36
"the scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.",0,65
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.,0,68
"then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter  is pure horror, really stupid.",0,98
"some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.",1,55
i really liked that.,1,20
a great film by a great director.,1,33
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.,1,114
the music in the film is really nice too.,1,41
i'd advise anyone to go and see it.,1,35
brilliant,1,9
10/10,1,5
i liked this movie way too much.,1,32
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside.,0,91
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.,1,93
"however, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.",0,93
"there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film, and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.",0,205
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.,0,110
"this was a poor remake of ""my best friends wedding"".",0,52
"all in all, a great disappointment.",0,35
"i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".",0,58
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing i.q.,0,72
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.,0,91
"imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.",0,113
"i saw ""mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.",0,70
"unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.",0,132
"these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.",0,120
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.,0,99
"it is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.",0,111
"you can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.",0,64
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.,1,77
"this movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen, it confuses you incredibly.",0,120
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.,0,98
"a truly, truly bad film.",0,24
"the acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.",0,49
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder.,0,76
i paid too much.,0,16
"also, it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse.",1,65
it was so boring,0,16
no plot whatsoever,0,18
"again, no plot at all.",0,22
horrible,0,8
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh,0,42
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief,0,74
i hate movies like that.,0,24
"yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.",0,35
there is no plot or storyline,0,29
"if you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.",0,103
awful.,0,6
i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.,0,64
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.,0,123
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes .,0,95
"this is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.",0,204
"crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.",0,141
"still, i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.",1,109
your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.,0,86
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover.,0,110
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.,0,105
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.,0,55
i mean this in a terrible way.,0,30
this film has no redeeming features.,0,36
everything is appalling.,0,24
"artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.",0,83
the story is beyond stupid.,0,27
the script iswas there a script?,0,33
the kids are annoying.,0,22
the lead man is charisma-free.,0,30
"utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.",0,60
i'll even say it again  this is torture.,0,41
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.,0,64
not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.,0,40
highly unrecommended.,0,21
"if this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.",0,51
"yes, it's that bad.",0,19
nothing at all to recommend.,0,28
an excellent performance from ms.,1,33
"garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work, but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.",1,177

"this movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.",0,68
there were too many close ups.,0,30

john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	1

it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	0
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles.  	1
his performance is simply genius.  	1
he owns the film, just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter"" and quaid owned ""great balls of fire.",1,1050
"in fact, it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  	1
ray charles is legendary.  	1
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
hitchcock is a great director.  	1
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
secondly, hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
this is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
and the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
he can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
when i first watched this movie, in the 80s, i loved it.  	1
i was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1
however, i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd, and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
i mean, in a realistic world, she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory... the whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
the character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
woa, talk about awful.  	0
do not waste your time.  	0
it was just too horrible.  	0
the worst, sappiest dialogue... i could go on and on.  	0
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
the poor actors.  	0
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick.  	0
if good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
the film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
regrettably, the film fails.  	0
the movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie.  	0
yet, i enjoy watching it.  	1
unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad  	0
the dialogue sucked.  	0
the cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  	0
the soundtrack sucked.  	0
the acting sucked.  	0
the concert sequences just sucked.  	0
that was nice.  	1
that was funny.  	1
it was so funny.  	1
overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
but this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
i came out of it feeling angry.  	0
***spoilers*** whatever else can  be said about it, surface is superbly crafted.  	1
the cinematography is simply stunning  and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1
conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody .  	1
and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
all things considered, a job very well done.  	1
thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
one of the best mexican movies ever, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
it ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura.  	1
the attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
it is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
up there with the best of melville.  	1
everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations  by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
the performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series.  	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded.  	0
there is a lot of beautiful places.  	1
it was forced, like everything in this movie.  	0
again, lame.  	0
here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  	0
and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick.  	0
summary: the witticisms weren't witty.  	0
the plot - well, i said i'd let that one go.  	0
the acting was bad.  	0
really bad.  	0
even billy bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	0
camerawork - again, bad.  	0
rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
he is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her tv, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1
i recommend this for everyone who loves film, movies, anything...a work of art  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	1
i literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled  story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap"".",0,7826
"to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, i can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt  .",0,193
"one more thing: i can tolerate political incorrectness very well, i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the slavic female character was just too much.",0,174
this is such a fun and funny movie.,1,35
highly entertaining at all angles.,1,34
"it features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.",1,73
"so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.",1,81
it even has its sweet moments.,1,30
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.,1,107
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played.,1,61
and i really did find them funny.,1,33
this is actually a very smart movie.,1,36
there is a brilliant twist ending.,1,34
"i love it.  	1
the ending is so, so perfect... you'll shed a tear.  	1
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  	1
i will never forget it now.  	1
it is not just a cult... it is a cult classic.  	1
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  	0
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	0
this movie is terrible.  	0
the hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  	0
for those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time  	0
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous  	0
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  	0
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  	0
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film.  	0
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  	0
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off.  	0
glad i didn't pay to see it.  	0
didn't laugh or even smile once.  	0
but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  	0
it is a really good show to watch.  	1
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  	1
barney is definitely super de duper.  	1
is pretty funny.  	1
babie bop is very cute.  	1
the kids are very cool too.  	1
 but ""storm trooper"" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.",0,1557
it's just lame.,0,15
the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.,0,78
everything about this movie is stupid.,0,38
"even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.",0,53
it is shameful.,0,15
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.,1,57
"the writers were ""smack on"" and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.these characters were so real.",1,125
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.,1,97
now you know why i gave it a 10+,1,32
"i don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.",1,150
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.,1,132
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.,1,83
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.,1,92
"much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.",1,88
everything from acting to cinematography was solid.,1,51
definitely worth checking out.,1,30
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen.,1,109
this movie has a cutting edge to it.,1,36
"i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.",1,139
"the new characters weren't all that memorable, and i found myself forgetting who was who.",0,89
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.,0,72
"it didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.",0,107
the jerky camera movements were also annoying.,0,46
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.,0,62
"there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.",0,121
"i guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.",0,106
"if you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.",0,62
"elias koteas,jack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets naked.billy drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.",1,228
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay.,1,60
"i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.but if anyone has a question about fort steele, just ask away:)",1,127
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times,0,176
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.,0,92
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.,0,118
"god, and i can never get that 90 minutes back",0,45
i think the most wonderful parts  are the excerpts from his works.,1,66
"the sets  are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.",1,59
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer.,1,53
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.,1,71
"after watching this film, i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.",1,80
"i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or japanese history.",1,107
"here, in the wind and the lion, we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age.",1,91
") what makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy - and vivid history.",1,218
"though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be sean connery's noble brigand, candace bergen's feisty heroine, john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, roosevelt's ""big stick"".",1,334
this is high adventure at its best.,1,35
"i think it was robert ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life, although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.",1,233
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.,1,71
"when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and i was impressed.",1,129
almost all of the songs in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.,0,77
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal.,0,101
"unfortunately, 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.",0,100
non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.,1,84
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful.,1,79
a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.,1,70
"for people who are first timers in film making, i think they did an excellent job",1,81
"it was very popular when i was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.",1,104
it's a feel-good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema,1,73
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.,1,70
i rather enjoyed it.,1,20
i liked it.,1,11
i couldn't take them seriously.,0,31
it really created a unique feeling though.,1,42
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script.,1,54
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today.,1,60
her role was played well.,1,25
not too screamy not to masculine but just right.,1,48
the camera really likes her in this movie.,1,42
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script.,1,60
"as a european, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.",1,216
i am a fan of his ... this movie sucked really bad.,0,51
even worse than ticker,0,22
& that movie was bad.,0,21
"only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations maybe, & poor hummh",0,74
it just blew.,0,13
"this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:scamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing 'ive never had this feeling before'.i totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on june 20.the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid.",1,377
"i just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.the junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.too funny i laughed,kids will love it.buy it when it comes out,it has new features",1,239
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda.,0,92
this show is made for americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.,0,109
"almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.",0,126
"i wish i could enter negative values, admins?",0,45
"the sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode.",0,79
"the use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting , no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.",0,290
"oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.",0,44
i hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which i really like the star - but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.,0,187
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.,0,139
in short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film.,0,113
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell.,0,126
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.,0,53
"an interesting premise, and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag .",1,79
"the soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.",1,39
"but the acting--even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon--was terrible, the directing worse , the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.",0,173
"still, it was the sets that got a big ""10"" on my ""oy-vey"" scale.",1,64
"yes, i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.",0,189
both do good jobs and are quite amusing.,1,40
"but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.",0,115
"i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.",0,74
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.,1,54
"bela lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.",0,55
"the acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period universal b movie.",0,80
"i like armand assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so i watched it, twice already, and probably will again.",1,128
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.,1,69
my 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.,1,37
"i won't say any more - i don't like spoilers, so i don't want to be one, but i believe this film is worth your time.",1,116
"wow, what a bad film.",0,21
"not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.",0,56
"the plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.",0,78
not even good for camp value,0,28
"i wasn't expecting oscar material, but this?",0,44
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.,0,84
this film  is an insult to the movie-going public.,0,50
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative,0,70
"this gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.",0,62
"this is one i did not have, but i watched it recently on fox movie channel, and was very disappointed.",0,102
"i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.",0,110
"victor mclaglen was even bad, and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable.",0,74
"considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.",0,149
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the president of the u.s.,0,77
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving.,0,44
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing.,0,65
"whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.",0,56
i was deeply impressed with the character he played.,1,52
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.,1,86
"a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting  and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo.",0,222
even the squibs look awful.,0,27
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america.,0,66
"the plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.",0,98
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.,0,108
"i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.",0,69
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.,0,58
"about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush, almost always in olde english, and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words.",0,257
the directing is sloppy at best.,0,32
"hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.",0,71
"of course, the acting is blah.",0,30
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.,0,111
"and, finally, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell.",0,137
"i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.",1,159
"i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.",1,116
"this movie contained an all-star cast, and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before.",1,138
"this movie was kind of long in length, but i enjoyed every minute of it.",1,72
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.,1,51
"lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.",1,112
"i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.",0,146
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.,0,106
"totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.",1,131
"this movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.",1,69
but this movie really got to me.,1,32
see it.,1,7
"i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.",1,134
"and i forgot: the casting here i superb, with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.",1,175
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.,1,58
"i found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.",1,54
"initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in buffalo, intrigued me.",1,86
later i found myself lost in the power of the film.,1,51
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.,1,60
"i left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.",1,87
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.,1,62
the rest of the cast also play well.,1,36
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers.,1,87
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts.,0,66
about half way through this film i started to dislike it.,0,57
"by the time the film ended, i not only disliked it, i despised it.",0,66
what this film lacks is a convincing script.,0,44
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.,0,112
"things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.",0,121
the cast is good.,1,17
"for that, it's worth checking out.",1,34
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life.,0,77
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen.,0,72
everything about it is just bad.,0,32
"i could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.",0,116
"the script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc-17 movie.",0,125
"the casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really bad actors, period.",0,86
final word: this show is a real torture,0,39
it is zillion times away from reality.,0,38
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.,0,86
rating: 0/10  note: the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show.,0,102
20th century fox's road house 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.,0,117
"full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.",0,195
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical,0,64
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.,0,91
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.,0,139
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me,0,49
this movie was a huge disappointment.,0,37
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.,0,54
the cast was great.,1,19
"steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.",1,98
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.,1,99
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.,0,46
"first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.",0,86
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.,0,135
"putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.",0,102
there is no real plot.,0,22
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.,0,40
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.,1,70
this second appearance of mickey mouse  is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.,1,115
"while you don't yet hear mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.",1,179
"however, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.",1,110
"it's just adorable seeing mickey playing ""turkey in the straw"" in a highly imaginative  way.",1,92
clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.,1,111
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug  is completely unconvincing.,0,64
"i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.",0,154
the original body and soul  is a masterpiece.,1,45
"john garfield, ann revere, lilli plmer, william conrad, canada lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..james wong howe.",1,162
i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.,0,63
this may be the only bad film he ever made.,0,43
so bad...well...it's just bad.,0,30
"this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.",0,82
it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this.,0,91
i thought it was bad.,0,21
"both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.",0,81
"let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.",0,101
the script is a big flawed mess.,0,32
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.,0,180
"director paul matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie ""grim"", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.",0,127
the movie is terribly boring in places.,0,39
the lighting is awful.,0,22
the film looks cheap and bland.,0,31
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.,0,66
"this convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.",0,79
the visual effects were awful.,0,30
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake,0,109
"the ""explosion"" of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful.",0,62
"okay, i like to consider myself a fair critic, so i'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.",1,134
"gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth",1,51
"to sum the film up, ""breeders"" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus.",0,116
not recommended.,0,16
"he is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.",0,102
"aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.",0,67
"i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.",0,205
"lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the pg-13 rating certainly won't allow.",0,156
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill .,1,44
"with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.",0,102
the budget was evidently very limited.,0,38
"this was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.",0,120
"however, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.",0,87
filmiing was less expansive.,0,28
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.,0,89
generally; it just lacked imagination.,0,38
not recommended.,0,16
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?,0,54
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.,0,59
"even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.",0,160
"beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period",0,62
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this,0,45
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review,0,55
"being a 90's child, i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons.",1,140
"but ""tiny toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.",1,119
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.,1,110
"easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way .",1,58
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.,1,90
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.,1,70
"every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.",0,116
"her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.",0,175
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.,1,86
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.,0,57
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie.,0,54
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles?,0,103
"to be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.",0,70
"in conclusion, i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense.",0,106
the story line is just awful,0,28
it's just painful,0,17
and the accents are absolutely abysmal,0,38
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.,0,60
don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.,0,64
i believe that pitch black was done well.,1,41
"the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.",1,171
go watch it,1,11
omit watching this.,0,19
very funny,1,10
my rating: just 3 out of 10.,0,28
the characters are interesting and you really care for them.,1,60
"an instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.",1,88
don't miss it.,1,14
"this is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.",1,477
"a mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances .",1,146
"but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.",1,213
"it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.",1,170
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.,0,100
"regardless, the film fails on most levels.",0,42
avoid at all costs.,0,19
"i saw this film over christmas, and what a great film it was",1,60
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor,1,85
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic,1,83
"i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and i grew up watching his films as a child.",1,137
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was.,1,82
i'll give this film 10 out of 10,1,32
"i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but george was well dull.",0,110
"he really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.",0,114
"lovely little thriller from hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.",1,176
"jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.",1,202
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.,1,71
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film,1,99
excellently produced by one of sci-fi's best producers scot vandiver ,1,69
"but it is entertaining, nonetheless.",1,36
it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.,1,48
there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.,1,82
the cast is always entertaining as usual.,1,41
"overall, a delight",1,18
"this movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.",0,74
the film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.,0,176
the least said about the acting the better.,0,43
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa.,1,123
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process.,1,176
nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.,1,69
"the acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. a must rent, view, or see.",1,133
don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10,1,78
excellent performance.,1,22
there still are good actors around,1,34
also great directing and photography.,1,37
"very true to shakespear, and a 'must' for all shakespear fans.",1,62
"macbeth he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.",1,108
"helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.",1,176
"if you love death and decay, and shakespears lyrics... this is the one.",1,71
"this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book, brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award.",1,147
"special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.",1,169
"however paul schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" mishima that is both superb & complex.",1,91
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar.,1,243
"even allowing for poor production values for the time , this is baaaaaad.",0,73
"unless you're just out to visually ""collect"" all extant films of austen's work, you can skip this one.",0,102
"if you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.",1,137
it is not good.,0,15
"speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.",0,63
then the film just dropped the ball.,0,36
this is a stunning movie.,1,25
raw and sublimely moving.,1,25
"it felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play  which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.",1,139
all of the main players are mesmerising.,1,40
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.,1,167
julian fellowes has triumphed again.,1,36
he's a national treasure.,1,25
go and see it,1,13
this is an excellent film.,1,26
the aerial scenes were well-done.,1,33
it was also the right balance of war and love.,1,46
"the film gives meaning to the phrase, ""never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.",1,121
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.,1,71
a good film by a great director,1,31
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.,1,108
"there are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.",0,222
this is just a great movie.,1,27
10 out of 10 stars.,1,19
i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.,0,102
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.,0,60
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema.,1,47
"shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style, watkins creates a film like no other.",1,117
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films.,1,51
i advise you to look out for it.,1,32
you wont regret it,1,18
highly recommended a+,1,21
well... just if you keep thinking how bad it is.,0,48
"it's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.",0,79
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.,0,40
") very bad performance plays angela bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.",0,91
"it is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.",0,76
how awful she is,0,16
"but she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.",0,89
"the results, well, are a shame.",0,31
delete this film from your mind,0,31
one of the worst shows of all time.,0,35
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.,0,114
"the fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???",0,100
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.,0,80
"every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, ""you see kids..."" pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.",0,129
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors.,0,47
lame would be the best way to describe it.,0,42
"stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility.",1,132
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character.,1,104
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.,1,75
"im big fan of rpg games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting rpger there is.",0,98
"the lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.",0,52
you can find better movies at youtube.,0,38
"top line: don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.",0,78
"a lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... forever.",0,65
that's how i'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.,0,68
"so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen.",0,130
"it isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.",0,86
"it's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.",0,39
"seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.",0,62
"avoid, avoid, avoid",0,19
it will drive you barking mad,0,29
the transfers are very good.,1,28
very nice and relaxing late night viewing.,1,42
the movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title,1,55
") some great music, and terrific scenery.",1,41
"it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here",1,95
") a happy, wonderful, feel good ending",1,38
"the point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.",1,76
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tv...never mind the fact that i already have it memorized,1,115
nothing new there.,0,18
that was done in the second movie.,0,34
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.,0,67
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.,0,115
what on earth is irons doing in this film?,0,42
i just saw this film and i recommend it.,1,40
"it has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good.",1,145
"a very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.",1,60
"tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.",1,250
"emily watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.",1,111
"despite the pans of reviewers, i liked this movie.",1,50
"in fact, i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat  better than cruise's attempt.",1,111
"aailiyah was pretty good as akasha, in places compelling .",1,58
"i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.",1,91
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.,1,66
the football scenes at the end were perplexing.,0,47
but i thought his acting was skilled.,1,37
meredith m was better than all right.,1,37
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.,1,56
it is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.,1,164
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.,1,40
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.,1,100
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's.,1,60
a standout scene.,1,17
this scene is very strong and unpleasant.,0,41
"technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.",1,226
it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.,1,80
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.,1,57
i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.,1,102
this movie is also revealing.,1,29
"personally, i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.",1,127
and it was boring.,0,18
"i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.",0,89
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.,1,99
"it's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.",1,48
"an italian reviewer called this ""a small, great film,"" and that's right.",1,72
"all the actors give a wonderful performance, especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.",1,201
"you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.",1,114
"the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the ""acting coach"" are fascinating.",1,130
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard.,1,71
you won't forget this movie,1,27
why was this film made?,0,23
the film has an ultra-cheap look to it.,0,39
the result is a film that just don't look right.,0,48
none of them are engaging or exciting.,0,38
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.,0,93
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time.,0,51
"i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973, when it was ""the stranger"" and i loved it.",1,82
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr.,1,235
this movie is so awesome,1,24
"i loved it, it was really scary.",1,32
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.,1,79
if you want a real scare rent this one,1,38
10/10,1,5
this is an extraordinary film.,1,30
"as a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the american justice system, it's frightening.",1,105
"this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.",1,167
"the film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen.",1,90
this mostly routine fact-based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole.,1,87
"predictable, but not a bad watch.",1,33
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.,1,70
she carries the movie well.,1,27
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.,1,132
"it is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd.",1,98
"how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's all wrong.",0,148
"in fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.",0,60
avoid at all costs,0,18
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series.,0,58
"the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.",0,267
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god  i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.,0,272
the only place good for this film is in the garbage.,0,52
the worst one of the series.,0,28
editing: the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.,1,63
"when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song old man by neil young was played, which evokes many emotions.",1,197
cinematography: the film was shot in an interesting way.,1,56
"of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.",1,79
this film offers many delights and surprises.,1,45
"when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from ""don giovanni"" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.",1,181
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.,1,127
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.,1,185
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression.,1,54
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.,1,63
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.,1,71
"the acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.",1,57
"the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly grimes and blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.",1,241
"angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist doctor quinn.",1,147
conclusion - i loved it.,1,24
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie.,1,55
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it.,1,48
"mark my words, this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.",1,170
"it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.",1,173
"the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.",1,243
"plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job",1,89
juano hernandez  is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south.,1,91
trumbull on i love lucy).,1,25
see it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.,1,140
see both films if you can.,1,26
"it was that year, however, that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella ""the dead.",1,172
"feelings, thoughts...gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal.",1,153
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist.,0,70
it's very slow.,0,15
lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.,0,150
) don't waste your time.,0,24
end of days is one of the worst big-budget action movies i've ever seen.,0,72
he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.,0,167
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen.,0,49
i'm still trying to get over how bad it was.,0,44
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.,1,69
"it has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... if you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.",1,197
"with great sound effects, and impressive special effects, i can't recommend this movie enough.  	1
call me a nut, but i think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle.  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of good lord, what were they thinking?  	0
lots of holes in the script.  	0
it's like a bad two hour tv movie.  	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
the dialogue is atrocious.  	0
the acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
everything stinks.  	0
trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
it's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
in short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
i won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
the best scene in the movie is at the end, but i won't spoil it.  	1
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it  	1
the result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
a film not easily forgotten.  	1
but, kevin spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
the characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
great movie  	1
also the story and acting were weak.  	0
at around 4 pm i bought it, at around 8pm i started to watch, at around 8.15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
either way, it sucks.  	0
the script is horrendously stupid.  	0
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
what the hell kind of crap is that?  	0
then, there's the plot holes.  	0
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
she's poised and amazing.  	1
dee snider just plain sucks.  	0
he can't act , he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
the acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special fx suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
avoid at any and all costs.  	0
at any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
avoid this film at all costs.  	0
i don't know what happened in season five, what a mess.  	0
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
now this is a movie i really dislike.  	0
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
the puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks.  	0
the story is lame, not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
i felt asleep the first time i watched it, so i can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
the fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1
the best part about nurse betty"" is it's unpredictability.",1,4429
"director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.",1,180

this one just fails to create any real suspense.,0,48
"as for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.",0,79

i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone.,0,55
"one of the most boring,pointless movies i have ever seen.",0,57
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.,0,100

this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad.,0,83
"i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie",0,101

i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it.,1,67

"hopefully, the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.",1,137
"i agree with jessica, this movie is pretty bad.",0,47
"characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.",0,79
the story line is totally predictable.,0,38
"not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.",1,109

paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.,1,155
the movie is not completely perfect but 'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.,1,125
i rate this movie 9/10.,1,23
"i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.",1,227
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie.,1,124
"kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""at play in the fields of the lord"".",1,144
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.,1,122
"it never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.",1,90
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen.,1,92
"they are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.",1,62
this movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.,1,57
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.,1,70
the story is also both funny and poignant at times.,1,51
"people who like european films and ""art movies"" will like this movie.",1,69
this is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.,1,63
go rent it.,1,11
"however, after finally watching this film, i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, i also found myself watching it over and over again.",1,174
"it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.",1,133
brilliance indeed.,1,18
"but if you liked movies like the matrix  i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.",1,137
think of the film being like a dream.,1,37
simply beautiful.,1,17
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.,1,139
"it's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.",1,88
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.,1,89
"just whatever you do, avoid ""groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic.",0,99
"it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.",0,175

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.,1,65
"each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.",1,82
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.,1,126
"hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili, ""gake no ue no ponyo""  is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.",1,138
"at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney/pixar's cgi masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.",1,255
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.,1,64
the art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.,1,100
"if you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible",0,104
"this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 , and this one fails everywhere.",0,97
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end  you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.,0,117

my first visit to hiro was a delight,1,36
service sucks.,0,14
the shrimp tender and moist.,1,28

the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.,1,56
today is the second time i've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.,1,80

the waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.,0,63
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.,0,85
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.,0,72
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.,1,87
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.,1,63
"the menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.",0,84
"the service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.",0,119

so don't go there if you are looking for good food...,0,53
i've never been treated so bad.,0,31
bacon is hella salty.,1,21
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.,0,114
"this really is how vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.",1,121
the waitresses are very friendly.,1,33
"lordy, the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers",1,71

"i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.",1,131
"after waiting an hour and being seated, i was not in the greatest of moods.",0,75
this is a good joint.,1,21
the macarons here are insanely good.,1,36

"not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.",0,53
the patio seating was very comfortable.,1,39
the fried rice was dry as well.,0,31

the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing,1,43
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste.,0,56

so in a nutshell: 1) the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.,0,97
my girlfriend's veal was very bad.,0,34
"unfortunately, it was not good.",0,31
i had a pretty satifying experience.,1,36
join the club and get awesome offers via email.,1,47

"great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.",1,44
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.,1,87
once your food arrives it's meh.,0,32
paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,0,134
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic.,1,45
"my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.",0,100

they were golden-crispy and delicious.,1,38
"i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.",0,132
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.,1,50
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.,0,119
"lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.",1,67
"the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience, i still tell people how awesome the duck was.",1,106

i can say that the desserts were yummy.,1,39
the food was terrible.,0,22
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.,1,47
it kept getting worse and worse so now i'm officially done.,0,59
this place should honestly be blown up.,0,39

do not waste your money here,0,28
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.,1,115
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.,1,42
awful service.,0,14
won't ever go here again.,0,25
food quality has been horrible.,0,31

"best service and food ever, maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.",1,87
they were excellent.,1,20
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job.,0,77
just had lunch here and had a great experience.,1,47
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.,0,127
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.,0,54
i recently tried caballero's and i have been back every week since,1,66
"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.",0,49
the food came out at a good pace.,1,33
"i ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.",1,76

the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.,1,47
i probably would not go here again.,0,35

my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.,0,69

i probably won't be coming back here.,0,37
worst food/service i've had in a while.,0,39
"this place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.",1,62
talk about great customer service of course we will be back.,1,60
"hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.i watched staff prepare food with bare hands, no gloves.everything is deep fried in oil.",0,147
i love their fries and their beans.,1,35
always a pleasure dealing with him.,1,35
"they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything i've tried gets my seal of approval.",1,98

"for sushi on the strip, this is the place to go.",1,48
"the service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.",1,71
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.,0,116
"i started this review with two stars, but i'm editing it to give it only one.",0,77
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costco's.,0,57

i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.,0,50
"the service was terrible, food was mediocre.",0,44
we definately enjoyed ourselves.,1,32

"on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well, and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.",0,133
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,0,49
the service was extremely slow.,0,31
"after 20 minutes wait, i got a table.",0,37

i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.,1,68

"i had strawberry tea, which was good.",1,37
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron,0,48
"overall, a great experience.",1,28
spend your money elsewhere.,0,27
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... mmmm...,1,96
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated.,0,55
"and the drinks are weak, people",0,31
-my order was not correct.,0,26
"also, i feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.",0,58
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0,61
the chips and sals a here is amazing,1,36

disappointing experience.,0,25

con: spotty service.,0,20
"the fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.",0,50
but then they came back cold.,0,29
"then our food came out, disappointment ensued.",0,46
the real disappointment was our waiter.,0,39
my husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,0,89

"insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.",0,107
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,0,114

after all the rave reviews i couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment,0,81

we've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,0,122
"i don't know what the big deal is about this place, but i won't be back ""ya'all"".",0,81
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,0,136

we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,0,88

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,0,105
"all in all, ha long bay was a bit of a flop.",0,44
the problem i have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub .,0,98
shrimp- when i unwrapped it  it was literally ice cold.,0,55
"it lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.",0,46
it really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,0,58
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage.,0,58
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.,0,90
spend your money and time some place else.,0,42
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad.,0,75
the presentation of the food was awful.,0,39
i can't tell you how disappointed i was.,0,40
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,0,66
